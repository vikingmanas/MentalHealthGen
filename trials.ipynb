      "1. **Address chronic adversity and stress**: Identify the sources of long-term suffering and stress in your life, and develop strategies to manage or mitigate them. This could involve seeking support from loved ones, therapy, or making lifestyle changes.\n",
      "2. **Process and cope with loss**: If you're experiencing a reaction to loss, allow yourself to grieve and process your emotions. Seek support from others, and consider professional help if needed.\n",
      "3. **Build self-esteem**: Focus on your strengths, accomplishments, and positive qualities. Practice self-compassion, and challenge negative self-talk by reframing it in a more positive and realistic light.\n",
